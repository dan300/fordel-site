				<h4>When Solutionsurfers met Fordel, the chemistry was obvious. We at the agency jumped head first into the world of brief coaching, a unique approach to coaching, derived from the methodology of family therapy. </h4>
				<p>Brief coaching is to personal growth as agile development is to software engineering - instead of focusing on the why nots, the method emphasises positive, future oriented steps and acknowledgement of progress. We all felt that it is a natural fit.</p>
				<p>Just like the dynamics in such a setting, the online presence of a fairly unknown school of thought is a complicated matter. We worked on balancing a wide audience with precise targeting, all the while keeping the content true to the philosophy of Solutionsurfers. Evangelizing without overbearing, talking without shouting. </p>

		<blockquote>It was important, that they understood immediately who we are and what our vision is. They liked what we wanted and thought it was important. I had the feeling that their attention is genuine: this is how they function. What’s more, they dictate a good tempo and usually overdeliver your best hopes in a good way.</blockquote>

				<p><b>We both felt strongly that marketing, SEO and traffic generation purposes can never override the authenticity of the brand and we kept this rule throughout the production of all blog posts and Facebook content.</b></p>
				A  content calendar was created, we brainstormed blog post topics with the client, wrote posts together and iterated them. After 3 months, we looked at the performance of posts and topics, identifying the ones driving more reach and better engagement. The table below shows the data of the results.</p>

			<div class="6u">
				<p>Instead of deploying pure technical solutions, we concentrated on authentic content and providing great service infrastructure with a tailored CRM system. (tailored how exactly? how does it work? why is it awesome?)<br />The results speak for themselves - Solutionsurfers’ latest event had a turn out 6 times the usual number with one happy client and a motivated agency. </b></p>

				<h3>Facebook Ads campaigns</h3>
				<p>Over the following year, we assisted Tickeron with planning and managing paid acquisition strategies on Facebook, AdWords, Quora, Twitter, Outbrain and several other, smaller self-service platforms. Using Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the agency’s digital marketing experts also helped Tickeron set up a system to measure in-app conversion points. This allowed Tickeron to identify problem areas that hindered conversion rates and make the necessary adjustments.</p>

				<h3>E-mail automation</h3>
				<p>Of course, acquiring customers is only half the battle — the other half is keeping them. Using a tool called customer.io, Fordel designed and helped Tickeron implement and maintain a marketing automation campaign intended to add value to paid users along their customer journey.</p>
